# Hack&Roll 2022 Project

## Inspiration

Covid has been around for a long time now and it has become quite difficult to meet up with friends already. But what makes it even more difficult is that everyone lives so far away! It's nearly impossible to find a "central location" that is convenient for everyone to meet up. And even if it is possible, it is definitely impossible to convince everyone that it is in fact a fair location. We're sure you have experienced this too. And this is where we come in. We use an algorithm to find the best place for you to meet your friends and we guarantee that it is the most convenient location for all of you. 
No more fights regarding where to meet. Only fights about where to eat once you get there.

## What it does

The app allows users to enter the nearest MRT to their houses and then runs an algorithm to find 3 optimal locations to meet. 

It ensures that everyone travels nearly the same amount and the total travelling time is minimised. It also provides a system for users to enter their preference - whether they want to meet up for going to a movie, or studying at a library or even going to a museum - and it takes this into account while finding the best MRTs to meet up. 

In short, it solves all disputes about where to meet up in an unbiased manner and keeps friendships intact <3 :)
